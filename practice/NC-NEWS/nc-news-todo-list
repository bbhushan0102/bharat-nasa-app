Readme
use ```js``` to make code snippets
No link to hosted vs
Package.json
Start and dev scripts set up for index.js => were you running your server at all how can this have worked?
Dont need ejs or bootstrap?? And why is mongod in the dependencies??
No seed script

Seed.dev
Don’t need toreturn mongoose…
Nice console.logs

Seed
Commented out code
Utils should be a seperate folder with an index.js inside
Don’t need to make a reference object for articles and comments: can just use your userDocs and .find()
2 different reference object makers??

App
Console.log in your catch connect to let developers know..
Commented out code: looks like you were going to abstract your error handlers


Errors
Commented out try to get this going :)

Controllers
Articles
Dont need to spread comments to rest them again
Over use of then blocks where you map over articles  and add comments to them… that’s synchronous code…
Could neaten up comment post by saying const newComments = {...req.body, belongs_to = article_id}  => same with posting article
Posting a comment and an article… not much by way of error handling- checking article exists and dealing with cast errors..
Articles by topic i think is supposed to be on topics route
No articles for a topic doesn’t necessarily mean 404: there could be legitimately no articles on a topic yet… validate that the topic exists instead
Vote function only difference in logic is the +1 or -1 : instead make a variable votes and pass that to the mongoose query (same with comments)
Topics
No error handling here

User
User should come back as an object, no? Why would you check the length?

Spec
Get rid of timeout
Some unfinished tests e.g. line 62
Refer more to the seeded data in tests: res.articles.length should be same as seeded-articles.length
Votes should be articles[0].votes +1 
Your controllers for posting appropriately get belongs to off params but in the tests you also send it on the req body
Commented out code
